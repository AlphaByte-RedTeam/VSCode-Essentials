//What is Compiler?//

A compiler is a special program that processes statements 
written in a particular programming language like C++ and 
turns them into machine language or "code" that a computer's processor uses.

//What is MinGW?//

MinGW, a contraction of "Minimalist GNU for Windows", 
is a minimalist development environment for native 
Microsoft Windows applications.

//Download and Install C++ Compiler//
1.) Head to www.mingw.org and click the "Download/Installer" link to
    download the MinGW setup file
2.) After downloading, install MinGW and wait for the "MinGW Installation
    Manager" to show up
3.) When the "MinGW Installation Manager" shows up, click on (mingw32-gcc-g++)
    then select "Mark for Installation"
4.) In the menu at the top left corner, click on "Installation > Apply Changes"
5.) Wait and allow to install completely. Ensure you have a stable internet
    connection during this process

//What is PATH?//

PATH is an environment variable on Unix-like operating systems, DOS, OS/2, and 
Microsoft Windows, specifying a set of directories where executable programs 
are located. In general, each executing process or user session has it's own 
PATH setting.


//Edit your PATH environtment variable to include the directory where
  the C++ compiler is located//

After installing MinGW, it can be found in (C:\MinGW\bin). Now you have to
include this directory in your environtment variable PATH. If you've been using
computers for a while now you should know how to do this already, but if you
don't, here are a few resources :

1.) From the Desktop/Windows Logo, right-click in the Windows Logo or Press Win+X
2.) From the Power User Task Menu, click "System"
3.) In the Settings Window, scroll down to the Related settings section and
    click the "System Info" link.
4.) In the System Window, click the "Advanced System Settings" link in the
    left navigation pane
5.) In the System Properties window, click the "Advanced" tab, then click
    the "Environtment Variables" button near the bottom of that tab
6.) In the Environtment Variables window, highlight the "Path" variable in the
    System variables section and click the "Edit" button. Add or modify the
    path lines with the paths you want the computer to access. Each different
    directory is separated with a semicolon, as shown below.

    C:\Program Files;C:\Winnt;C:\Winnt\System32
    C:\MinGW\bin
    C:\Users\(nama_user)\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code\bin

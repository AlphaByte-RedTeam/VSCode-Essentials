Step 1: Check with CMD if your system already has Java JDK or not,
	the command is 'javac' without single quoatation mark.
	
	If the CMD show message that internal or external command is
	not recognize, it means Java JDK has not installed in your
	system.

Step 2: Follow this step to download Java JDK

1. Go to your web browser
2. Search for Java JDK
3. Look for Version 8 and Version 11 or latest is reccomended
4. Download both version (Version 8 and Version 11/latest)

8. Right click on your mouse >> properties >> Advance System Settings

10. On path C:\MinGW\bin >> add more value into this path
11. Go to page explorer by pressing Win + E
12. Go to C:\ >> Program Files >> Java
13. And then go to folder name jdk.1.8.0_271 (this JDK Version 8),
    go to folder bin, and then copy the path 
    C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_271\bin  --> like this
14. And then copy it into the path and seperating it using a semicolon
    like C:\MinGW\bin;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_271\bin
